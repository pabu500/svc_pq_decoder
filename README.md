## pq_decoder
PQ Decoder (or COMTRADE Decoder) is a tool developed to decode COMTRADE (Common Format for Transient Data Exchange) files. It reads .cfg (configuration) and .dat (data) files, enabling users to extract, process, and analyze Power Quality (PQ) data.
The primary goal of this project is to convert COMTRADE files into more user-friendly formats, such as CSV or JSON, making it easier for users to inspect and analyze the data using familiar tools.

## Features
Parse COMTRADE files (.cfg and .dat) according to the IEEE C37.111 standard.
Extract both analog and digital signal data.
Handle various formats including binary and ASCII
Generate output in formats like CSV, JSON, or directly manipulate data via code.
