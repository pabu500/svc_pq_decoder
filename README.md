## pq_decoder
PQ Decoder (or COMTRADE Decoder) is a tool developed to decode COMTRADE (Common Format for Transient Data Exchange) files. It reads in .cfg (configuration) and .dat (data) files, enabling users to extract, process, and analyze Power Quality (PQ) data.
The primary goal of this project is to convert COMTRADE files into more user-friendly formats, such as CSV or JSON, making it easier for users to inspect and analyze the data using familiar tools.

## Features
- Parse COMTRADE files (.cfg and .dat) according to the IEEE C37.111 standard.
- Extract both analog and digital signal data.
- Handle various formats including binary and ASCII
- Generate output in formats like CSV and JSON

## installation guide
- download intellij
- pull the latest pq_decoder from https://github.com/pabu500/pq_decoder.git repo
- run the backend
- have some UI to upload the cfg and dat file byte data to the pq_decoder backend
- endpoint : process_pqd
